# NBA_FanDuel_ML


For this project, I created around 50 learning parameters and ran the data through Ridge Regression, ElasticNet, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and SVM algorithms.  Ridge regression consistently had the lowest average root mean square error (RMSE) between all positions.  
I used pandas and sklearn libraries for data creation and the learning.
